# Easy: Best Time To Buy and Sell Stock II

## Conceptualization

If you have gone through the breakdown of the Problem 121, you might be familiar with the premise of this task.

You must calculate the maximum profit, the maximum difference, from an array of integers. Each integer in the list represent a price, which could be thought as a buying price or a selling price. 

The catch is that, unlike in Problem 121, this time you are concerned with multiple transactions. However, you can only have 1 buying price and 1 selling price.

Here is an example from the problem's prompt


```
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 7

Explanation:
	Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. 
	Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 -3 = 3.
```

There are two intervals where the profit was obtained from, [day 2, day 3] and [day 4, day 5]. Notice how there is no overlap between these interval, they are exclusive. This is what is meant by a single buying price and selling price.

This may seem like a monumentally more challenging problem than Problem 121. In reality the solution is as simple.

## Approach 1:

```python
def max_profit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
	# If prices is empty, then return 0
	if not prices:
		return 0

	# Initialize a max_profit variable
	max_profit: int = 0
	# For-each loop variables:
	# . i: Index of current price
	# . price: Current price
	for i, price in enumerate(prices):
		# If last element of prices list, break loop
		if i == len(prices) - 1:
			break

		# If the current price is less than the next price
		# Add the difference of the prices to max_profit
		if price < prices[i + 1]:
			max_profit += prices[i + 1] - prices

	return max_profit
```
