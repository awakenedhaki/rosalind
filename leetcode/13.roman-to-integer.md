# Easy: Roman to Integer

## Conceptualization

Before attemping this problem, you must understand how roman numeral work. When do you substract? When do you add?

```
IV  = 4
VI  = 6
```

In the above example, we have `IV` that equals `4`. While the reverse equals `6`. We can infer from this example that if a current value is less than the next value, the current value will substract. We can also infer that the last number in the sequence of roman numeral will always be added.

Arithmatics in programming languages do not work on roman numerals, unless you have found one or created one that does. Therefore, we will have to find a way to translate roman numerical to arabic numerals.

```python
roman_to_int = {
    'I': 1,
    'V': 5,
    'X': 10,
    'L': 50,
    'C': 100,
    'D': 500,
    'M': 1000
}
```

Let's look at a more complex example. Keep the above dictionary for reference.

```
MCMXCIV = 1994
```

With our current conceptualization, we don't know where to start dividing and where to start adding. Sure, left and small is subtract. Right and big is add. But, how do we decide where the center is?

Well, in reality, as we go through this example we will keep changing the center of the roman numeral. We start by having the center be the largest single value in the roman numeral.

```
MCMXCIV = 1994

First largest split = M
Index               = 0

Rest                = CMXCIV
```

As we go through this process or splitting the roman numeral by the largest value, we must also keep an accumulator variable that keeps track of the total sum.

```
MCMXCIV = 1994

First largest split = M
Index               = 0

Total               = 1000
Rest                = CMXCIV
```

The second largest value would also be `M`

```
Second largest split = CM
Index                = 1

C < M, therefore, M - C = 900
Total                = 1900
Rest                 = XCIV
```

## Approach 1:

The follow solution is one way to implement that above concept.

```python
def romanToInt(s: str) -> int:
    # Dictionary mapping a roman numeral to 
    # its integer representation
	roman_to_int: Dict[str, int] = {
        'I': 1,
        'V': 5,
        'X': 10,
        'L': 50,
        'C': 100,
        'D': 500,
        'M': 1000
    }
	# The sum total of a roman numeral
    total: int = 0
	# List of int, generated from roman numeral
    integers: List[int] = [roman_to_int[i] for i in s]
    # Current max integer index
    i_max: int = integers.index(max(integers)) 
    while integers:
        # List of int upto current max integer
        max_slice: List[int] = integers[:i_max + 1]
        # List of int after the the current max integer
        integers: List[int] =  integers[i_max + 1:]
        # Checks if integers is empty
        if integers:
            # New max integer index
            i_max = integers.index(max(integers))
		# Adding the max integer of max_slice, and 
        # subtracting preceding integers
        total += max_slice[-1] - sum(max_slice[:-1])
    return total 
```

## Approach 2:

This is a more sophisticated version of the above solution.

```python
def romanToInt(s: str) -> int:
    # Dictionary mapping a roman numeral to 
    # its integer representation
    roman_to_int: Dict[str, int] = {
        'I': 1,
        'V': 5,
        'X': 10,
        'L': 50,
        'C': 100,
        'D': 500,
        'M': 1000
    }
	# Sum total of a roman numeral
    total: int = 0
	# For-each loop variables:
   	# . i: Index of current roman numeral
    # . rnumeral: Current roman numeral
    for i, rnumeral in enumerate(s):
        # Integer value of current roman numeral
        integer: int = roman_to_int[rnumeral]
        if i < (len(s) - 1):
            # If on the last roman numeral
            total += roman_to_int[rnumeral]
            break
        elif integer < roman_to_int[s[i + 1]]:
            # If current roman numeral is less than the next one
            total -= roman_to_int[rnumeral]
        else:
            # If all other cases are false
            total += roman_to_int[rnumeral]
    return total

```
