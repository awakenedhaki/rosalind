# Easy: Two Sum

Both approaches are similar in template, but one implements a dictionary for optimization.

## Approach 1:

The first approach is intuitive. As you iterate over the list of integers, `nums`, you would check if the difference between the `target` and the current integer is within the `nums`. If it is, return the index of the current integer, and the difference.

Here is an explanation of the variables used in the function:

-   `difference`: The difference between the `target` and the `num`. If it is guaranteed that there are two numbers that when added equal `target`, then `difference` must be an integer within `nums`.

    ```
    List of integers: [2, 7, -1, 4]
    Target:           9
    
    Difference:       9 - 2 = 7
    ```

-   `offset`: The index of the next integer in the list of integers. If the two integers that add to `target` are equal to each other, then searching for the index without an offsetted `nums` will return the current integers index.

    ```
    List of integers: [3, 3]
    Target:           6
    
    Difference:       6 - 3 = 3
    
    Current integer index:              0
    Index of difference without offset: 0 
    List of integers with offset: 		[3, 3] - offset -> [3]
    Index of difference on offsetted list, then adding offset: 1
    ```

-   `difference_index`: The index of the `difference`, following the above example.

```python
def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    # For-each loop variables:
    # . i: The index of the current item in the iterable
    # . num: The integer
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # The difference between target and current integer
        difference: int = target - num
        # Lookahead offset for nums collection
        offset: int = i + 1
        # Check if difference is in offsetted nums
        if difference in nums[offset:]:
            # Index of difference/summand in offsetted nums + offset
            difference_index = nums[offset:].index(difference) + offset 
            return (i, summand_index)
```

## Approach 2:

A better solution would be to keep track of very `difference` in a dictionary. In the dictionary, the key is the `difference` between the `target` and a given integer from `nums`. The value is the index of that given integer. As it continues to iterate over the list of integers, it checks if the current integer is a key in the constructed dictionary. If it is present, the it will return the value which the key maps to, and the current index.

Here is an explanation of the variables used in the function:

1.  `minuend_indices`: This is the dictionary that holds the difference as a key, and the index of the minuend as the corresponding value.

    -   Minuend is fancy math vocabulary for the following:

    ```
    difference = subtrahend - minuend
    ```

    -   Where the difference is the result of a substraction. The subtrahend is the number being subtracted, and the minuend is the number doing the subtraction. Therefore, any integer in `nums` is a minuend, and `target` is the subtrahend.

An advantange of this solution is the that use of `in` syntax, which calls on the `__contains__` dundermethod, executes in __O(1)__ time, compared to the __O(n)__ time that it takes on a list.

```python
def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    # A dictionary:
    # . Key: Difference
    # . Value: Index of the minuend
    minuend_indices: Dict[int, int] = {}
    # For-each loop variables:
    # . i: The index of the current item in the iterable
    # . num: The integer
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # The difference between the target and current integer
        difference: int = target - num
        # Check if current integer is in dictionary
        # . If the current integer is within the dictionary, it means
        # . that that integer is equal to an already encountered difference
        if num in minuend_indices:
            # The index of the integer that equal the difference when
            # subtracted from the target
            minuend_index: int = minuend_indices[num]
            return (minuend_index, i)
        # Adds minuend index to dictionary, if difference is not found
        minuend_indices[difference] = i 
```
