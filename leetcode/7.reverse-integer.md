# Easy: Reverse Integer

## Approach 1:

1. Obtain absolute value
2. Convert to string
3. Reverse string
4. Convert to int
5. Check if input is negative
    - True: temporary variable by -1
    - False: Do nothing
6. Check if reversed integer is less than integer overflow:
    - True: Return 0
    - False: Return reversed integer

```python
def reverse_integer(integer: int) -> int:
    output: int = int(str(abs(x))[::-1])
    # Check if input is negative
    if x < 0:
        # Convert output to negative if input was negative
        output: int *= -1
    # Return output if it is a 32 bit signed integer, otherwise return 0
    return output if (output <= (2**31) - 1) and (output >= (-2**31)) else 0
```

## Approach 2:

### Challenges:

1. Obtain individual integers, without converting to string.
2. Grow a return value using individual integers

```
Input:           123
First iteration: 3
Growing output:  3

Second iteration: 2
Growing output:   32

Third iteration: 1
Growing ouput:   321
```

### Conceptualizaton:

When dividing a number by 10, you are reducing the number by one order of magnitude:

```
Input:                       123
Quotient when divided by 10: 12
Remainder of quotient:       3
```

By reducing the value by one order of maginute via each iteraton, and obtaining the remaider, you can parse an integer value to its individual components.

Next, the obtained remainder will have to grow onto the desired output. If the remainder where a string, you could simply append the next remainder to the end of the growing output. However, since these are integers, such logic does not apply.

However, a similar chain of logic does exist. Here is an example:

```
Input:                       123

Iteration: 1
    Quotient:                    12
    Remainder of quotient:       3
    Growing ouput:               3

Iteration: 2
    Quotient when divided by 10: 1
    Remainder of quotient:       2
    Growing output:              32
```

The input is being reduced by one order of magnitude per iteraton. The growing output goes from `3` to `32` between iteration 1 and iteration 2. This is achieved by multiplying the growing output by `10` and then adding quotient remainder.

```
Iteration: 1
    Quotient:                    12
    Remainder of quotient:       3
    Growing ouput:               3
    Growing output time ten:     30

Iteration: 2
    Quotient when divided by 10: 1
    Remainder of quotient:       2
    Growing output:              30 + 2 = 32
    Growing output times ten:    320
```

Now, you would only want to multiply the growing output by 10 if there are any remaining numbers.

The general solution would then be:

```
Growing output = (Prev Growing output * 10) + Remainder
```

### Implementation

```python
def reverse_integer(x: int) -> int:
    # Factor to convert output into a negative number, if input is negative
    sign: int = 1 if x > 0 else -1

    # Initializing an output accumulator
    output: int = 0
    # Absolute value of input
    x: int = abs(x)
    while x:
        # Obtaining:
        # . remainder: The remaining value from a division
        # . x: The quotient
        x, remainder = divmod(x, 10)

        # Add the remainder to output times 10
        output = (output * 10) + remainder
    # Add required sign to output, if any
    output *= sign
    # Return output if it is a 32 bit signed integer, otherwise return 0
    return output if (output >= -2**31) and (output <= (2**31) - 1) else 0
```
