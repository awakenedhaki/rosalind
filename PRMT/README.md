# Calculating Protein Mass

## Problem
In a weighted alphabet, every symbol is assigned a positive real number called a weight. A string formed from a weighted alphabet is called a weighted string, and its weight is equal to the sum of the weights of its symbols.

The standard weight assigned to each member of the 20-symbol amino acid alphabet is the monoisotopic mass of the corresponding amino acid.

__Given:__ A protein string P of length at most 1000 aa.

__Return:__ The total weight of P. Consult the monoisotopic mass table.
